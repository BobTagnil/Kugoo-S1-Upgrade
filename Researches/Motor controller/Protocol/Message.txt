From the display to the MK controller, UART packs 8 bytes with 9600 8n1 speeds.
Packages go at 20 Hz.
The following

data are:3E 04 - start of protocol (identification data for mk controller);
01 - current transmission (01 / 02 / 03);
00 - 8 (senior) bit - state of the headlight. 7 bits is set in 1 if the transmission button is held for 5 seconds.
00 - accelerator level %)(0-100
; 00 - Recovery braking level (0-100 %);
00 05 - The control amount is considered as the arithmetic addition of all bytes in the parcel, excluding the title. Example on si: CRC'Byte1'Byte2'... If the MK controller stops receiving packages
from the display for more than 1
second, the MK controller is blocked (includes the electric brake) and in packages from the MK byte controller the status is set at 00 (lock).


From the MK controller to the display, UART packs 11 bytes with 9600 8n1 speed
settings.
Packages go about twice a second.
The following

data are:3C 07 - start of protocol (identification data for the display);
01 - MK controller status (00 - lock / 01 - normal operation / 03 - settings accepted);
00 - service indicators (use 3 junior bits, on bat on each indicator). 0 bit (junior) - "M" indicator. 1 bit - "ECU." 2 bits - "!";
00 - current consumption (the display can also display negative values, but the MK controller does not transmit the value of the recovery current). Negative tots may not show all displays;
0B B8 - time between the pulses of the tahodatchik (speed);
00 00 - unknown;
00 CB - The control amount is considered to be the arithmetic addition of all bytes in the parcel, excluding the title. Example on si: CRC'Byte1'Byte2'...
Transfer settings from the display to the MK
controller.



2 seconds after the display is turned on, save or cancel service settings, the display controller sends the MK controller a 16-by-byte UART data package with 9600 8n1: 3E 2C - start protocol (identification data for the MK controller);

0B - version of the firmware of the display controller (parameter 0 service menu);
00 - zero start (parameter 1 service menu);
3C - speed limit (parameter 2 service menu);
28 - wheel diameter (parameter 3 service menu);
1E - number of magnets (parameter 4 service menu);
32 - power of the first speed (parameter 5 service menu);
46 - power of the second speed (parameter 6 service menu);
64 - power third speed (parameter 7 service menu);
01 - disabling cruise control (parameter 8 service menu);
00 - Option 9 service menu;
00 - option 10 service menu;
00 - 11 service menu option;
01 96 - The control amount is considered as the arithmetic addition of all bytes in the parcel, excluding the title. Example on si: CRC'Byte1'Byte2'...
After accepting the settings, the MK controller responds with the value of the byte status of 03 (settings are
taken).
